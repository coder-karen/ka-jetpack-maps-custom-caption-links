## About

Extend the Jetpack Map block with custom caption links.

This plugin extends the Jetpack Map block by allowing you to add clickable links to marker captions. You can also set the caption link color based on four preset colors. A demo section allows you to type in your caption text, add your link, and add your link text. Clicking preview changes the demo caption text to include the link markup, which you can then copy over to the marker you'd like to add the link to.

## Usage
